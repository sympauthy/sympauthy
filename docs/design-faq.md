# Design FAQ

Questions that came up during development, the options considered, and what was decided. It exists
so that a settled question stays settled, and so that a decision that looks arbitrary from the code
can be read with its reasoning attached.

**An entry belongs here when the answer is a choice rather than a rule.** A rule — something every
future change has to hold to — belongs in the standard that owns it, where it will be found by
someone about to break it. A choice is something that was decided once, could defensibly have gone
the other way, and does not generalise: it is only ever read by someone asking "why is it like
this?"

Each entry names the decision, the options that lost, and why. An entry may be reopened; it is
edited in place when it is, so the document says what is true now rather than accumulating a
history.

## MFA

### Should clients control whether MFA is required, and which methods are enabled?

**Decision:** No. MFA policy is global.

**Options considered:**

- **Global policy only** — the requirement and the enabled methods apply to every client uniformly.
- **Per-client overrides** — each client's configuration could carry its own requirement and method
  list.

**Rationale:**

SympAuthy is built around a single user pool shared by every client. Per-client MFA control would
produce a confusing experience — the same person challenged on one application and not on another —
and a real bypass, since a client could opt out of a policy the deployment enforces globally.

The deeper reason is that enrolment is a property of the person, not of the client: someone has one
authenticator regardless of which application sent them here. A policy attached to the client would
be describing something the client does not own.

Audiences group clients for the purposes of consent, but they do not create separate populations of
users. Per-audience MFA policy is the version of this that could be reconsidered later; per-client
is not.
